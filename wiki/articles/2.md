# METRICS and CHECKS 

M&C are the first steps of MLops preparation cycle for the production. 

In this project, you can find two types of M&C: 

 - Metrics and Checks defined on Datasets 
 
 You can find examples of pre-built and custom-based M&C for [transactions_joined](dataset:transactions_joined) and [transactions_joined_prepared](dataset:transactions_joined_prepared) 

 - Metrics and Checks defined on the  **M** odel **E**valuation **S**tore (MES) 
 
Example: [the_MES](model_evaluation_store:Rci28BcL)
