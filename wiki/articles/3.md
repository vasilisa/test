# SCENARIOS 

The project illustrates some examples of scenarios with custom and time-based triggers and with the use of scenario steps and Python API. 

Documentation on scenarios is [here](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/scenarios/index.html)


[Automatic Deployment](scenario:AUTOMATICDEPLOYMENT) - Example of automatic deployment of the project bundle using steps 

[Automatic Deployment Python](scenario:AUTOMATICDEPLOYMENTPYTHON) - Example of automatic deployment of the project bundle to the automation node using Python API. 

Note, that you need to set up the automation node and Deployer prior to running these two scenarios. 

[Data drift monitor](scenario:DATADRIFTMONITOR) - Example of the scenarios with different triggers and a combination of conditional steps. 

[loop_through_reports](scenario:LOOP_THROUGH_REPORTS)
Example of a scenario that loops through different mailing lists to send the reports
Uses an example of the custom based Python trigger

### CONDITIONED SCENARIOS
Some of the scenarios contain conditinal statements
[Automatic Deployment Python with CONDITION](scenario:AUTOMATICDEPLOYMENTPYTHON)
[Data drift monitor with CONDITIONS](scenario:DATADRIFTMONITOR)

We recommend reading these two community posts to better understand the process:

1. [How to create conditinal scenarios](https://community.dataiku.com/t5/What-s-New/Want-to-Control-the-Execution-of-Scenario-Steps-With-Conditional/ba-p/31472)
2. [Debugging](https://community.dataiku.com/t5/Using-Dataiku/Scenario-Defining-a-variable-using-a-computed-metric/m-p/36098)
Note that forthe non-partitioned dataset the name should be ```<DATASETNAME>_NP``` with ```NP``` added at the end.
